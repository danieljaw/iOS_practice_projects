// Create a name constant and assign it a string literal representing your name.

let name = "Daniel"


//Create a favoriteQuote constant and assign it the following string literal:

//"My favorite quote is <INSERT QUOTE HERE>."

//Write in your own favorite quote where indicated, and be sure to include escaped quotation marks. When finished, print the value of favoriteQuote.

//If your favorite quote is "The grass is always greener on the other side" the value of favoriteQuote should be such that printing favoriteQuote results in the following:

//My favorite quote is "The grass is always greener on the other side."

let favouriteQuote = "\"The grass is always greener on the other side.\""
print("My favorite quote is \(favouriteQuote)")

// Write an if-else statement that prints "There's nothing here" if emptyString is empty, and "It's not as empty as I thought" otherwise.

let emptyString = ""

// 1st way - myślę, że to jest dobrze

if emptyString.isEmpty {
    print("There's nothing here")
} else {
    print("It's not as empty as I thought")
}

//2nd way - to też może być
if emptyString == "" {
    print("There's nothing here")
} else {
    print("It's not as empty as I thought")
}


// jeśli zmienimy wartość stałej emptyString widać, że oba napisy się zmieniają.
