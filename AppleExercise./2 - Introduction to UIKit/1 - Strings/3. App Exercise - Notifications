// App Exercise - Notifications


// In your app, you may want to search for other users. This would be easier with first and last names stored separately. This is not an uncommon practice.

// Create firstName and lastName constants and assign them string literals representing a user's first name and last name, respectively. Create a fullName constant that uses string concatenation to combine firstName and lastName. Print the value of fullName.


let firstName = "Daniel"
let lastName = "*********"

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
