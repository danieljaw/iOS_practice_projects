// App Exercise - Notifications


// In your app, you may want to search for other users. This would be easier with first and last names stored separately. This is not an uncommon practice.

// Create firstName and lastName constants and assign them string literals representing a user's first name and last name, respectively. Create a fullName constant that uses string concatenation to combine firstName and lastName. Print the value of fullName.


let firstName = "Daniel"
let lastName = "*********"

let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

// Occasionally users of your fitness tracking app will beat previous goals or records. You may want to notify them when this happens for encouragement purposes. Create a new constant congratulations and assign it a string literal that uses string interpolation to create the following string:

// Insert fullName, previousBest and newBest where indicated. Print the value of congratulations.


let previousBest = 14392
let newBest = 15125
// żeby zapamiętać = concentration -> kiedy dodajemy +, interpolation kiedy mamy \()

let congratulations = "Congratulations, \(fullName)! You beat your previous daily high score of \(newBest) steps by walking \(previousBest) steps yesterday!"
print(congratulations)
