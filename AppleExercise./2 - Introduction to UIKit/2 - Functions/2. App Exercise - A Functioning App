// As you may have guessed, functions are key to making your app work. For example, in every exercise dealing with step count until now, you have simply assigned a number of steps to a steps variable. This isn't very realistic seeing as the number of steps you take increments one at a time and continues changing throughout the day.

// A reoccurring process like this is a perfect candidate for a function. Write a function called incrementSteps after the declaration of steps below that will increment steps by one and then print its value. Call the function multiple times and observe the printouts.

var steps = 20_000

func incrementSteps() {
    steps += 1
    print(steps)
}
incrementSteps()
incrementSteps()
incrementSteps()
incrementSteps()
incrementSteps()
