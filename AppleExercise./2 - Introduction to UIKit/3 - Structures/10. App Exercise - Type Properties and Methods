// App Exercise - Type Properties and Methods


// In another exercise, you added a computed property representing the average mile time from a run. However, you may want to have a calculator of sorts that users can use before their run to find out what mile time they need to average in order to run a given distance in a given time. In this case it might be helpful to have a type method on RunningWorkout that can be accessed without having an instance of RunningWorkout.

// Add to RunningWorkout a type method mileTimeFor(distance:time:) where distance and time are both of type Double. This method should have a return value of type Double. The body of the method should calculate the average mile time needed to cover the passed in distance in the passed in time. Assume that distance is in meters and that one mile is 1600 meters.
