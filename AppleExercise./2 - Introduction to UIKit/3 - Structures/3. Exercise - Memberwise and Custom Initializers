// If you completed the exercise Structs, Instances, and Default Values, you created a GPS struct with default values for properties of latitude and longitude. Create your GPS struct again, but this time do not provide default values. Both properties should be of type Double.

struct GPS {
    var latitude: Double
    var longitude: Double
}

// Now create a constant instance of GPS called somePlace, and use the memberwise initializer to set latitude to 51.514004, and longitude to 0.125226. Print the values of somePlace's properties.


// just to be clear: memberwise initializer - wtedy kiedy mamy nazwÄ™ struktury i nawiasy

let somePlace = GPS(latitude: 51.514004, longitude: 0.1252226)
print(somePlace.longitude)
print(somePlace.latitude)

// In Structs, Instance, and Default Values, you also created a Book struct with properties title, author, pages, and price. Create this struct again without default values. Give each property the appropriate type. Declare your favoriteBook instance and pass in the values of your favorite book using the memberwise initializer. Print a statement about your favorite book using favoriteBook's properties.
