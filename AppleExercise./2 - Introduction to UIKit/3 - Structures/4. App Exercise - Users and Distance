// App Exercise - Users and Distance

// These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

// For most apps you'll need to have a data structure to hold information about a user. Create a User struct that has properties for basic information about a user. At a minimum, it should have properties to represent a user's name, age, height, weight, and activity level. You could do this by having name be a String, age be an Int, height and weight be of type Double, and activityLevel be an Int that will represent a scoring 1-10 of how active they are. Implement this now.

struct User {
    var name: String
    var age: Int
    var height: Double
    var weight: Double
    var activityLevel: Int
}

// Create a variable instance of User and call it your name. Use the memberwise initializer to pass in information about yourself. Then print out a description of your User instance using the instance's properties.

var daniel = User(name: "Daniel", age: 25, height: 183, weight: 100, activityLevel: 3)

print("User's name: \(daniel.name) and age: \(daniel.age). His hight is \(daniel.height) cm and weight \(daniel.weight) kg. Activity level is - around \(daniel.activityLevel) level")
