// App Exercise - Workout Functions

// These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

// A RunningWorkout struct has been created for you below. Add a method on RunningWorkout called postWorkoutStats that prints out the details of the run. Then create an instance of RunningWorkout and call postWorkoutStats().

struct RunningWorkout {
    var distance: Double
    var time: Double
    var elevation: Double
    
    func postWorkoutStats() {
        print("The distance is \(distance) meters, total time was \(time) and elevation was at the level of: \(elevation) meters.")
    }
}

var instance = RunningWorkout(distance: 2345, time: 13.5, elevation: 987.1)
instance.postWorkoutStats()
