// App Exercise - Workout Functions

// These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

// A RunningWorkout struct has been created for you below. Add a method on RunningWorkout called postWorkoutStats that prints out the details of the run. Then create an instance of RunningWorkout and call postWorkoutStats().

struct RunningWorkout {
    var distance: Double
    var time: Double
    var elevation: Double
    
    func postWorkoutStats() {
        print("The distance is \(distance) meters, total time was \(time) and elevation was at the level of: \(elevation) meters.")
    }
}

var instance = RunningWorkout(distance: 2345, time: 13.5, elevation: 987.1)
instance.postWorkoutStats()

// A Steps struct has been created for you below, representing the day's step-tracking data. It has the goal number of steps for the day and the number of steps taken so far. Create a method on Steps called takeStep that increments the value of steps by one. Then create an instance of Steps and call takeStep(). Print the value of the instance's steps property before and after the method call.

struct Steps {
    var steps: Int
    var goal: Int
    
    mutating func takeStep() {
        steps += 1
    }
}
