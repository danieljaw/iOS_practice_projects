// Exercise - Computed Properties and Property Observers

// The Rectangle struct below has two properties, one for width and one for height. Add a computed property that computes the area of the rectangle (i.e. width * height). Create an instance of Rectangle and print the area property.

struct Rectangle {
    var width: Double
    var height: Double

    var computedArea: Double {
        width * height
    }
}
