// Exercise - Computed Properties and Property Observers

// The Rectangle struct below has two properties, one for width and one for height. Add a computed property that computes the area of the rectangle (i.e. width * height). Create an instance of Rectangle and print the area property.

struct Rectangle {
    var width: Double
    var height: Double

    var computedArea: Double {
        width * height
    }
}

let areaProperty = Rectangle(width: 10, height: 40)
areaProperty.computedArea
print(areaProperty.computedArea)

// In the Height struct below, height is represented in both inches and centimeters. However, if heightInInches is changed, heightInCentimeters should also adjust to match it. Add a didSet to each property that will check if the other property is what it should be, and if not, sets the proper value. If you set the value of the other property even though it already has the right value, you will end up with an infinite loop of each property setting the other.
