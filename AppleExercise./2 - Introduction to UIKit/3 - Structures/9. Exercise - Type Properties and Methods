// Exercise - Type Properties and Methods


// Imagine you have an app that requires the user to log in. You may have a User struct similar to that shown below. However, in addition to keeping track of specific user information, you might want to have a way of knowing who the current logged in user is. Create a currentUser type property on the User struct below and assign it to a user object representing you. Now you can access the current user through the User struct. Print out the properties of currentUser.

struct User {
        
    var userName: String
    var email: String
    var age: Int
}
