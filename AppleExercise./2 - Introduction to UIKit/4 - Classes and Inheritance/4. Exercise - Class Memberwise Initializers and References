// Exercise - Class Memberwise Initializers and References

// Exercise - Class Memberwise Initializers and References The exercises below are based on a game where a spaceship avoids obstacles in space. The ship is positioned at the bottom of a coordinate system and can only move left and right while obstacles "fall" from top to bottom. The base class Spaceship and subclasses Fighter and ShieldedShip have been provided for you below. You will use these to complete the exercises.

class Spaceship {
    let name: String
    var health: Int
    var position: Int
    
    init(name: String, health: Int, position: Int) {
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.position = position
    }

    func moveLeft() {
        position -= 1
    }

    func moveRight() {
        position += 1
    }

    func wasHit() {
        health -= 5
        if health <= 0 {
            print("Sorry, your ship was hit one too many times. Do you want to play again?")
        }
    }
}
