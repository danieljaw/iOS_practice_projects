// Exercise - Dictionaries


// Create a variable [String: Int] dictionary that can be used to look up the number of days in a particular month. Use a dictionary literal to initialize it with January, February, and March. January contains 31 days, February has 28, and March has 31. Print the dictionary.


var miesiaceOrazDni: [String: Int] = [:]
miesiaceOrazDni = ["January": 31, "February": 28, "March": 31]
print(miesiaceOrazDni)


// Using subscripting syntax to add April to the collection with a value of 30. Print the dictionary.


miesiaceOrazDni["April"] = 30
print(miesiaceOrazDni)


// It's a leap year! Update the number of days in February to 29 using the updateValue(_:, forKey:) method. Print the dictionary.


miesiaceOrazDni.updateValue(29, forKey: "February")
print(miesiaceOrazDni)


// Use if-let syntax to retrieve the number of days under "January." If the value is there, print "January has 31 days", where 31 is the value retrieved from the dictionary.


if let numberOfDays = miesiaceOrazDni["January"] {
    print("January has \(numberOfDays) dni.")
}


//Given the following arrays, create a new [String : [String]] dictionary. shapesArray should use the key "Shapes" and colorsArray should use the key "Colors." Print the resulting dictionary.


let shapesArray = ["koło", "trójkąt", "prostopadłościan"]
let colorsArray = ["czerwony", "żółty", "pomarańczowy"]

var secDict = ["Shapes": shapesArray, "Colors": colorsArray]
print(secDict)



// Print the last element of colorsArray, accessing it through the dictionary you've created. You'll have to use if-let syntax or the force unwrap operator to unwrap what is returned from the dictionary before you can access an element of the array.


if let lastElementFromColorsArray = secDict["Colors"]?.last {
    print(lastElementFromColorsArray)
}
