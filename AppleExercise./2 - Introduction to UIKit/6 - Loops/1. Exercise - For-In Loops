// Exercise - For-In Loops

// Create a for-in loop that loops through values 1 to 100, and prints each of the values.


for val in 1...100 {
    print("Wartość: \(val)")
}


// Create a for-in loop that loops through each of the characters in the alphabet string below, and prints each of the values alongside the index.a

let alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

for char in alphabet {
    print(char)
}

// Create a [String: String] dictionary, where the keys are names of states and the values are their capitals. Include at least three key/value pairs in your collection, then use a for-in loop to iterate over the pairs and print out the keys and values in a sentence.

var capitals: [String: String] = [:]
capitals = ["Polska": "Warszawa", "Niemcy": "Berlin", "Czechy": "Praga", "Włochy": "Rzym"]

for (pansto, stolica) in capitals {
    print("The capital of \(pansto) is \(stolica).")
}
