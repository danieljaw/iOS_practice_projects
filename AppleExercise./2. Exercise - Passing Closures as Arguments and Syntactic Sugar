// Define a function forwards that has two String arguments, name1 and name2, and returns a Bool. Within the definition of the function, print each of the arguments, then return whether or not name1 is less than name2. You can use comparison operators, such as < and >, to compare alphabetical order in strings.

func forwards(name1: String, name2: String) -> Bool {
    print(name1)
    print(name2)
    return name1 < name2
}

// Create a [String] collection using names of your friends and family. Call the collection's sorted(by:) function, passing in forwards as the argument. Store the result into sortedCollection1, then print the result. This should sort your collection alphabetically.
