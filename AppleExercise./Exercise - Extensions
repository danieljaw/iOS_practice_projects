// Exercise - Extensions

// Define an extension to Character that includes a function isVowel(). The function returns true if the character is a vowel (a,e,i,o,u), and false otherwise. Be sure to properly handle uppercase and lowercase characters.




//Create two Character constants, myVowel and myConsonant, and set them to a vowel and a consonant, respectively. Use the isVowel() methods on each constant to determine whether or not it's a vowel.
