/* Simple array which in my case should be 2 dimensional
*/

// first 
let quiz = [
    "Four + Two is equal to Six.",
    "Five - Three is greater than One",
    "Three + Eight is less than Ten."
    ]
    
// now if I want to look through my array I have to simply write:

quiz[0] // and the result will be printed

// but if I want to make this 2dimensional or even 3
