/* Simple array which in my case should be 2 dimensional
*/

// first 
let quiz = [
    "Four + Two is equal to Six.",
    "Five - Three is greater than One",
    "Three + Eight is less than Ten."
    ]
    
// now if I want to look through my array I have to simply write:

quiz[0] // and the result will be printed

// but if I want to make this 2dimensional or even 3

//2 dimensions 
    let quiz = [
    ["Four + Two is equal to Six.", "True"],
    ["Five - Three is greater than One", "True"],
    ["Three + Eight is less than Ten.", "True"],
    ]
    
    
/* 
I can now see that there is two seperate arrays inside the "parent" array.
I can look for the last element by:
*/

quiz[2][2] // And the result will be showed. Anyway, there is even more arrays to write
